First attempt at a top down tower defense game, with a slightly different take on the genre.

Player must run around to upgrade the towers while the enemies are attacking.
Instead of the end goal of the enemies being a point on the map like normal tower defense the end goal is the player.
The path the enemies must take is defined by the turrets placed by the player.
